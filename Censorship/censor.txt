Censorship Program

Basis:
This program will essentially act as a censor to obscene words from either standard input or from a file

Source:
badwords.txt (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/)

Command-Line Options:
-v             : verbose option (display number of words inputted, number of words censored, and number of words after censorship)
-i input_file  : user-specified input file to censor (default is standard input)
-o output_file : user-specified output file (default is standard output)

Setup:
First read in obscene words from badwords.txt and append them into a bad_words array

Reading Standard Input
Use input() to get input from user and split the input using split() so input is converted into an array so we can censor obscene words
After reading input, print out the censored response to screen if user has raise the verbose (-v) flag
