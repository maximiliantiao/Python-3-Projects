# Python 3 Projects

This repository consists of several miscellaneous programs and projects that I have embarked on for the purpose of fun applications of my current knowledge of the Python language.

# Banking System
Just a fun little project I did with classes and an important module, sqlite3. This is a my first experience using a lightweight relational database module for Python. Purpose of the project was the stimulate a fairly simple banking system with abilities to make accounts, deposit & withdraw money, view user information, change password, and other features.
