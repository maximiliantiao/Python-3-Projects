# Python 3 Projects

This repository consists of several miscellaneous programs and projects that I have embarked on for the purpose of fun applications of my current knowledge of the Python language.

# Banking System
Just a fun little project I did with classes and an important module, sqlite3. This is a my first experience using a lightweight relational database module for Python. Purpose of the project was the stimulate a fairly simple banking system with abilities to make accounts, deposit & withdraw money, view user information, change password, and other features.

# Censorship (WIP)
What inspired to create this program was program that was assigned to me back in Fall 2019 in a programming class. During that time, I did it in C so I decided to redo the assignment in Python for fun:)

# Random Programs (WIP)
Title. Random programs from random ideas I have when I stare into the continuum of space and time.

# Tic-Tac-Toe
Just like the game itself.

# Web Parser
Folder with web parsers that parse a website using requests and Beautiful Soup module.
